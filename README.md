# Redis

This is the core [Apache Brooklyn](http://brooklyn.apache.org/) integration for deployment and in-life management of [Redis](http://redis.io/). The details of this catalog item are covered [here](http://brooklyn.apache.org/learnmore/catalog/catalog-item.html#!entities/org.apache.brooklyn.entity.nosql.redis.RedisStore).

Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes with radius queries. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction,
 transactions and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.
